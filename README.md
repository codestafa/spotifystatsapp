## Getting Started

First, run `npm install` in both the backend and the frontend directory.

Next, create a .env.local file in the backend and copy and paste the variables from .env.dev

You will need to change them from empty quotation marks to the actual keys.

To run the backend, you will need to build it first.

## Working with the Spotify API

1. Log into the dashboard using your Spotify account.

2. Create an app and select "Web API" for the question asking which APIs are you planning to use. Once you have created your app, you will have access to the app credentials. These will be required for API authorization to obtain an access token.

3. Use the access token in your API requests.
